# WolfProductions | Photos

This application takes your photo gallery to the next level. I wanted a way to group albums together for different organisations or categories. So I wanted to group my personal albums together and seperate them from other albums. I also wanted to share a single album as a gallery where you can have the photos grouped into sections like pixieset can do, and I want to share a whole collection of albums from a category or organisation in a grid view. Overall I wanted to create a platform to share my photos and have lots of grouping I can do.

I run this app myself on [wolfproductions.photos](https://wolfproductions.photos), but it is also open source and free available for you to use and deploy yourself. Just follow the instructions below to get started.

## Getting started

The application uses the following technologies which we don't provide (I will however provide a basic setup guide for these technologies):

- [AWS S3 storage](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for saving the photos
- [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) for storing information about the albums and sections.

The application itself runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).
